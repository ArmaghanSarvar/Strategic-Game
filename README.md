# Strategic-Game
this is my advanced programming course final project with java.
the "resources" file which is uploaded is actually just some of the pictures used in the project(related to autumn) and some other pnj files in it are not uploaded.
this code has two main AI and self playing parts. it can also be muliplayer by the java networking used in it.
